The quality of workmanship is consistently excellent, with great attention to detail and a strong work ethic. Always turns up when they say they will and gets the job done right. A true professional and a pleasure to work with.",

The crew built new decking under extremely hot and challenging conditions, but still finished on time, and to a high standard. Do yourself a favour and use James for your next home improvement.

      "comment": "Very much recommend James!\n\nFirst, I had James around to sort out further build out of a tricky fireplace feature wall that required a bit of work to ensure stable and ready for installation. Second, also just helped me in a last minute change I needed, only hours before fireplace and tv installation.\n\nHe visited multiple times just to make sure the ask was possible, and got straight to the job, no stuffing around and the results speak for itself.\n\nHe’s easy to work with, professional, attention to detail, timely and just good at his trade.\n\nI highly recommend James and JLC Carpentry and Building Services. I’ll be having him back for a few additional things I’d like to tackle next.",

When circumstances demanded improvisation, James was highly adaptable--suggesting beneficial changes to the original plans.  His useful advice received my quick approval.  James finished on time and on budget and he provided frequent informative updates (with photos).  Throughout the project, there were prompt responses to questions and easy communication in general.  I have no hesitation in strongly recommending JLC for similar renovations.",

He attended the office, provided a competitive quote and sourced quality timber to complete the project. On-site the team were on time, produced a great product and cleaned any waste. Highly recommended",

He was always on time, super proactive, and never once complained, even when we threw a few extra tasks his way. It was such a relief having someone who genuinely cared about getting everything perfect.\n\nOur bathroom looks amazing, and we genuinely couldn’t recommend James enough",

The final product showcases his exceptional craftsmanship and attention to detail. I couldn’t be happier and highly recommend JLC Carpentry for top-notch work! Will definitely be using James again for any future work at my property.",
