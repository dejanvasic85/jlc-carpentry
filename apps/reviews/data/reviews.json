He was always on time, super proactive, and never once complained, even when we threw a few extra tasks his way. It was such a relief having someone who genuinely cared about getting everything perfect.\n\nOur bathroom looks amazing, and we genuinely couldn’t recommend James enough",

He came through for me last minute, arrived exactly on time, and wasted no time getting straight to the job. No fluff — just results.\n\nHe not only fixed the door perfectly, but his craftsmanship and attention to detail were outstanding. It’s rare to find someone who’s both punctual and delivers this level of quality without needing to be micromanaged.\n\nIf you’re looking for someone who shows up, executes with precision, and treats your project like it’s his own James is your guy. I highly recommend him and hope this review brings him all the business he deserves. He’s earned it.",

      "comment": "James and his team renovated my bathroom.  They were dependable and performed solid work.  When circumstances demanded improvisation, James was highly adaptable--suggesting beneficial changes to the original plans.  His useful advice received my quick approval.  James finished on time and on budget and he provided frequent informative updates (with photos).  Throughout the project, there were prompt responses to questions and easy communication in general.  I have no hesitation in strongly recommending JLC for similar renovations.",
