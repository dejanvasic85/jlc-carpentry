      "comment": "James and his team renovated my bathroom.  They were dependable and performed solid work.  When circumstances demanded improvisation, James was highly adaptable--suggesting beneficial changes to the original plans.  His useful advice received my quick approval.  James finished on time and on budget and he provided frequent informative updates (with photos).  Throughout the project, there were prompt responses to questions and easy communication in general.  I have no hesitation in strongly recommending JLC for similar renovations.",

He attended the office, provided a competitive quote and sourced quality timber to complete the project. On-site the team were on time, produced a great product and cleaned any waste. Highly recommended",

      "comment": "We recently had the pleasure of working with James for our full bathroom renovation, and couldn’t be happier with the results.\n\nJames handled everything—organizing all the trades, managing the project, and making sure things ran smoothly. He was always on time, super proactive, and never once complained, even when we threw a few extra tasks his way. It was such a relief having someone who genuinely cared about getting everything perfect.\n\nOur bathroom looks amazing, and we genuinely couldn’t recommend James enough",
