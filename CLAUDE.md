# Commands
- npm run type:check: Run the typechecker
- npm run format: Run the formatter

# Code style
- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax, not CommonJS (require)
- Destructure imports when possible (eg. import { foo } from 'bar')

# Workflow
- Be sure to typecheck when youâ€™re done making a series of code changes
- Use `npm run format` whenever the format is not correct
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance

# Dependency management
- Always pin dependencies to a specific version
- Ensure to find the latest version of a package before adding it
- For styling solutions, prefer to use latest CSS versions instead of libraries like Tailwind or Bootstrap
- Avoid using deprecated packages or APIs
- Always install packages at the root of the monorepo targeting the correct workspace with -w <workspace-name>
